# NumPy Data Explorer
**Syntecxhub Data Science Internship – Week 1**

## Overview
This project explores the core features of **NumPy**, including:
- Array creation and manipulation
- Indexing and slicing
- Mathematical and statistical operations
- Reshaping and broadcasting
- Saving/loading arrays
- Performance comparison with Python lists

## Objective
To understand how NumPy improves data manipulation performance and efficiency compared to standard Python operations.

## Requirements
```
pip install numpy
```

## How to Run
```
python numpy_data_explorer.py
```

## Output Includes
- Array operations demonstration  
- Axis-wise mathematical operations  
- Reshaping and broadcasting example  
- NumPy vs Python list performance timing
